# Aether Architect: Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: The Problem
**Software Development is Slow & Expensive.**
- "Blank Canvas Paralysis" kills ideas before they start.
- Misalignment between PMs and Engineers causes rework.
- Setting up "Enterprise Quality" boilerplate takes days.

## Slide 2: The Solution
**Aether Architect.**
- AI that thinks like a Principal Engineer.
- Input: "A CRM for dentists."
- Output: A fully working React app with architecture docs, design system, and clean code.
- Time: < 60 Seconds.

## Slide 3: How It Works
1. **Understand:** It writes a PRD first.
2. **Design:** It invents a coherent design system.
3. **Build:** It writes atomic, semantic React components.
4. **Refine:** It iterates based on feedback.

## Slide 4: Market Opportunity
- **Low-Code/No-Code Market:** $187B by 2030.
- **Developer Tools:** $15B+ market.
- Aether sits at the intersection: "AI-Code".

## Slide 5: The Secret Sauce
- **Recursive UI Tree Generation:** Unlike LLMs that output flat HTML, Aether builds a semantic tree.
- **Alchemy Engine:** Vision-based UI critiquing and remixing.
- **Google Gemini 2.0:** Utilizing the massive context window for maintaining whole-app state.
