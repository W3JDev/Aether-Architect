# Product Vision

## Executive Summary
Aether Architect aims to eliminate the "Blank Canvas Paralysis" in software development. By leveraging multimodal AI, we empower developers, product managers, and founders to go from a "napkin sketch" idea to a fully code-backed prototype in under 60 seconds.

## Core Value Proposition
1. **Speed:** Reduce initial prototyping time by 95%.
2. **Consistency:** Enforce enterprise design tokens automatically via the generated Design System.
3. **Quality:** Output code that is semantic, accessible, and clean—not just "spaghetti code" that looks good.

## Target Audience
- **Solution Architects:** Rapidly proof-of-concept complex systems.
- **Product Managers:** Visualizing PRDs without waiting for design cycles.
- **Frontend Engineers:** Bootstrapping boilerplate UI to focus on business logic.

## Strategic Pillars
1. **"One Prompt, Full App":** The AI should infer missing details rather than halting for input.
2. **"Code You Can Keep":** The output must be indistinguishable from a senior engineer's code.
3. **"Visual Intelligence":** The ability to "see" existing designs and iterate on them (Alchemy Mode).
